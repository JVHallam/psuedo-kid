I want to keep things simple.
I want a list of low level functions that don't call other non-standard library functions inside of them.

I then want some functions that build on that, and pipe things between them.

Higher level:
    psuedokid

Low level:
    Traversal
    Logic

At the minute, this isn't the case. But this is the end hope. That way, testing is more segmented.
It means that functions that a function that calls a function that allocates memory, can also free that memory.
