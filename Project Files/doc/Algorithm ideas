Single Spot algorithm:
    The most basic of sudoku algorithms. The idea that a number can only occupy a single spot in an area.

    After eliminating all other spots that a value can be put into, without violating sudoku rule, you should be left
    with a single location where a value can be placed.

    This algorithm can only be caried out on areas.


Single Occupant:
    It's sort of like the inverse to the above. This takes a cell and instead, finds the only number that can be
    entered into it without breaking sudoku rule.

    A value for a cell may fit the single occupant rule at times it doesn't quite fit the single spot algorithm.

Phantom Occupancy:
    If 2 cells in the same area have only 2 possible occupants and both list of occupants match, these cells are as
    good as occupied when using the single spot algorithm.

    This can only be carried out on areas.
