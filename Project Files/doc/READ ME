This is supposed to serve as documentation on how the program works, or something along those lines.

What's a puzzle file:
	A puzzle file represents an unsolved sudoku puzzle.

	It must contain numbers in ascii value.

	It must contain 81 numbers.

	Empty spaces on a sudoku are represented by the value 0

	Non-empty spaces are represented by their value from 1 to 9

	If non-numeric values are present (Letters, spaces, newlines) the program will skip over them 
	and move onto the next value.
	Due to this, it doesn't matter what's in the file, aslong as it contains 81 values from 0 to 
	9.
