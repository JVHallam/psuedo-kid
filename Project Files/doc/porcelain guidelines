The program should work as follows:
    Algorithms -> Porcelain abstraction layer -> the plumbing functions (grid.h, traversal.h, logic.h)

This way, when i'm dabbling with algorithms, the algorithms have zero access to the table directly. No more manual pointer manipulation.

When a value is changed, porcelain will be updating our tables values automatically.
