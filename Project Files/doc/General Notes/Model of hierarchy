I want things to be made as modular and simple as popular, but this time, i want to do it right:

Grid.h:
    This will contain any constants that i decide to use, ROW CHAMBER CELL, etc.

    It will contain the definitions for a cell.

    It will contain the constructor for the grid.

    It will also contain the the definition for the function that parses a file into a grid.

Traversal.h:
    This is going to contain only code that relates to getting an area of the grid.

Logic.h
    This is going to contain functions that return only boolean values. is_present, is_valid, is_full

Algorithms.h:
    This is going to contain my algorithms. They'll pull on the data from the previous headers to solve the grid.

Main.c:
    Parse file.

    Call algorithms until complete or stuck.

    End.
