Single Spot algorithm:
    The most basic of sudoku algorithms. The idea that a number can only occupy a single spot in an area.

    After eliminating all other spots that a value can be put into, without violating sudoku rule, you should be left
    with a single location where a value can be placed.

    This algorithm can only be caried out on areas.


Single Occupant:
    It's sort of like the inverse to the above. This takes a cell and instead, finds the only number that can be
    entered into it without breaking sudoku rule.

    A value for a cell may fit the single occupant rule at times it doesn't quite fit the single spot algorithm.

Subline theorem:
	If a value in a chamber
	has only 2 cells that it is valid in
	then it's safe to say that i will occur in one of those 2 cells.

	If these 2 cells are in the same line, then the number will occur in that line.
	Therefore, all other cells in that line, cannot hold the value.

	If a value in a line can only be held by 2 cells and those 2 cells are in the same chamber,
	It's safe to assume that the number will occur in those 2 spaces. Therefore, the value cannot
	occur anywhere else in the chamber.

Phantom Occupancy:
    If 2 cells in the same area have only 2 possible occupants and both list of occupants match, these cells are as
    good as occupied when using the single spot algorithm.

    This can only be carried out on areas.
