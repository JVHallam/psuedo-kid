I've just worked out that i'm doing this all wrong!

The code should be re-worked from start to finish:
	Work out how to do a sudoku

	Find out what KEY functions will be needed in:
		Logic.h

		Traversal.h

	Re-work the test code to work with these key functions, only.

	Then, and only then, Can we progress to making this more complex and covered properly by unit tests.
