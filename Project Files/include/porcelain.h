	The point of porcelain is to do all of the table management and correspond with the
	following algorithms file.

	The most basic of basic functions:
		porcelain.c should not be returning ANY pointers

		added_to_tables(file_name_that_becomes_key)

		int get_value(cell index, key)

		BOOL set_value(cell_index, key)
			Then goes and updates all other values

		BOOL is_present(area_index)

	Whenever a change is made, porcelain should set all of the valid values of cells that are
	effected.
